I never thought it would be this rough, I love this new space, I love the factory-like smell, I love that it's underground, I love how empty it is, how it's open 24/7, how theres 2 shopping carts, how loud we can be.
<br><br>
I love how perfect its distance is away from the bathroom,
<br><br><br>
just long enough for me to pick up skating.

An immense amount of security to be indulgent, manifested itself through solidarity. It's new years eve and we're waiting for our order, it's Chinese new year and I'm shaking my coke so it be smoother for my taste.
<br><br>
It's 5am and we're waiting for the printshop to open.
</p>

I never realized I have to share a desk with someone else.
<br><br>
I can't wait to hang with the cool kids, I can't wait to be sketching with Prismacolors, I can't wait to learn photoshops, alias, to form studying groups.
<br><br><br>
I cant wait to be appreciated.

4 to 6am is always the coldest.
<br><br>
Covered in dust and paint. This home stretch period is always a pain in the ass. Still it seems inspiring, for being the only people to still be working now, to see how empty the street is, to feel like I really earned this plate of freshly fried noodles.
<br><br><br>
I love this superficial feeling of humbleness.

"No e-cigarettes allowed here"
<br><br>
We are so far ahead, so vain and so proud of it. Everyone's going everywhere. Things became so easy, we hack the system, yet with 100% earnest. We feel special, special enough to be making jokes with the sternest professor, special enough to soak in our 40 dollar happiness.
<br><br><br>
Everything is beyond perfect, a self-engineered ecstasy.

"It's opening in 2 days"
<br><br>
Somehow I always knew it's going to end up at this place. My eventual indifference manifested itself into passive aggressiveness and condescension. It is the exact ending I was looking for, 
<br><br><br>
and it is messy.
</p>
`

var story6 = `
<p>
"日工五甲 何宗翰“
<br><br>
It never went away, the indifference. I realized that I won't feel much if I don't act much. Yet somehow I still don't know what to think of it. Sitting in a classroom knowing full well that this is a waste of time.
<br><br><br>
I was given complete agency with zero words to say.
</p>

"Buckle up"
<br><br>


It's almost too quiet, external party with no affiliation to the place ended up finishing the last stroke. I never liked the sappy sentimentality, and yet it almost felt like it ended long ago. There was no revelation, every choice was made with 100% self-awareness.
<br><br><br>
I never stopped looking back.
